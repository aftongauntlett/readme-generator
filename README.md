## About this project: 

This repo is a ```README.md``` generator. You can clone and run this repo on your computer to auto generate a boilerplate ```README.md``` file for any project. It comes preloaded with a set of questions you simply fill out and it does the rest. Once you enter your Github username, it will pull certain information, like your email, straight from your Github profile! 

## Description

Your README will be populated with the following:

* 1 Social Badge displaying your Github Followers.
* Developed by - Your Github link
* Your email - auto generated from your github information (will display null if your email is set to private in github)
* Project title
* Description
* License
* Installation
* Tests
* Additional Info about your project
* Getting Started
* Your profile image from Github



# Installation 

1. Clone respository

```sh
npm i
node index.js
```

# Getting Started:

Follow the installation directions above. From your console, you will be prompted to answer a series of questions. Once you have asnwered each question, that is it! Your ```README.md``` file is now created. You will find it in a folder titled "output", from there, you can move it wherever and you are done!

Congratulations, no more writing boring ```README.md's``` on your own.
